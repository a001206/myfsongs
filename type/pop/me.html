                Small talk, no conversation<br>
                That look makes me impatient<br>
                I can't tell what you're thinkin<br>
                Please tell me what you're thinkin<br>
                Last night we were more than fine<br>
                Just tell me if you changed your mind<br>
                If you changed your mind (mind)<br>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Cause I'm all, I'm all in<br>
                I'm callin', no answer<br>
                But you text me when you feel like<br>
                When it feels right to you<br>
                But I'm all, I'm all in<br>
                I'm fallin' faster<br>
                But if you're looking at me with a<br>
                Heart of doubt\<br>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Don't kiss me right now<br>
                Don't tell me that you need me<br>
                Don't show up at my house<br>
                All caught up in your feelings<br>
                Don't run me round and round<br>
                Don't build me up just to let me<br>
                Down, just to let me<br>
                Down, down, down (eh)<br>
                Don't mess with my head<br>
                Don't tell me you're falling<br>
                With your feet still on the ledge<br>
                I'm all out of breath, baby<br>
                Don't run me round and round<br>
                Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me<br>

                You know you got me in the palm of your hand<br>
                But I love those hands<br>
                Ah, yeah<br>
                But you only let me hold you when he can't<br>
