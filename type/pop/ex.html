        I haven't spoken to ya,<br>
        haven't seen you in months<br>
        Too busy living so we fell out of touch<br>
        I didn't think I had to let<br>
        you know we were done<br>
        We weren't together<br>
        so how could we break up<br>
        You got the chance to tell<br>
        everybody your side<br>
        It's my turn to tell 'em mine<br>
        You came to my place a couple of times<br>
        Got high and you slept over<br>
        Just a few days, just a few nights<br>
        You and I were never sober<br>
        If you wanted something more<br>
        then you shoulda asked<br>
        Would you please stop<br>
        acting like the ex I never had?<br>
        I'm checkin' my texts and readin' 'em back<br>
        We were cool, at least I thought so<br>
        Seein' all this and hearin' all that<br>
        We were good but I guess we're not though<br>
        It was never real enough for you to be mad<br>
        So why you out there<br>
        acting like the ex I never had?
    </p>
